For once, the world felt small—
    a cocoon spun from threads
    of hesitation and fear.

    The walls were safe, but walls all the same.

Outside them no longer seemed worth the risk.

Then came a gentle breeze—
    unexpected,
    soft,
    but insistent.

    A whisper of warmth,
        carrying the scent of possibilities I had forgotten how to dream of.

Slowly, the threads loosened.
    Not with force,
    not with demand,

    but with the quiet presence of something…
        someone who saw the wings I had long hidden away.

With each word—
    some typed,
    many unspoken…

    came another small crack of light,
        a nudge towards the heights I thought I couldn’t again reach above.

The sweet breeze—
    open,
    alive,

    ripe with the hum of trust given and received.

The courage to emerge didn’t come all at once,
    but it came,
    nonetheless.

    Because transformation isn’t a single moment;
        it’s a thousand tiny ones,
        each led by the quiet,
        steady presence—

        Of a butterfly willing to flutter close…
                                                and stay.
