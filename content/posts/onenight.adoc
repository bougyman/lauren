= One Night

That night,
    the stars could have aligned—
    but instead, we found ourselves

    lost in the glow of our screens.

The plan was simple:
    Park Tavern,
    two drinks,

    and the chance to meet beneath the glow of city lights.

But instead, the pull of our couches proved stronger than gravity.

Me: lost in the galaxy far, far away—
    “Skeleton Crew” spinning tales
    of heroes and hope.

What did her screen show?

Perhaps a crime drama,
    all shadows and suspense.

Maybe a romantic comedy,
    a safe haven of laughter and warmth.

Or could it have been something quiet—
    a documentary,
    tracing the lines

    of history and memory?

The night slipped by, marked only
    by the soft hum
    of electronics

    and the silence between two distant rooms.

And though the streets outside waited empty,
    the real meeting place
    remained unvisited—

    a shared moment deferred,
        lingering in the space
            between what was
                and what might yet be.

But now, as dawn breaks here—
    and the stars fade into the light,
    I find myself wondering:

    Was it the night that was lost,
        or the chance to find…
                              something more?

Only time will tell.
    but for now,
    One Night remains…

    unclaimed.
