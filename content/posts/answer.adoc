Six days since the spark—
    a handful of hours,
    yet a lifetime measured in words,

    exchanged between the spaces of one breath and the next.

We’ve built a bridge of laughter and stories,
    moments shared
    futures imagined.

    Each message is a plank, steadying a path we've dared to walk.

We spoke of dogs—
    the joy,
    the loyalty,
    the salvation...

    the way their eyes hold secrets of a world simpler and yet infinitely wiser.

I spoke of the ones who had wandered through my life,
    leaving paw prints on my soul.

And as you listened, it felt like we were painting something unseen but real
    something both fragile and unbreakable.

The hours slipped away, but I stayed anchored to you.

Your words wrapped around me like a warmth I didn’t realize I had been missing.

Could this—
    this quiet unfolding,
    this recognition in the small things.

    Not a grand declaration, but the steady hum of belonging?

For now, I don’t need to know.

It is enough to meet you there.
    that place where our worlds overlap

And now, every word feels like

    An Answer

To the question I didn’t know I was asking.
