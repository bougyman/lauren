Here is The List,
    complete and unabridged.

I've been building for days—
    recording those moments,
    when my thoughts aren't of you.

All of those times
    without visions
    of our meeting.

    The crystal clear ultra 8k cinematic scenes
        of our first embrace.

Life is so full
    of things to do,
    and sometimes…

    I feel like I've done them all.

So many ways
    to fill the hours,
    and yet—

    Few rise to the top, these days.

But I spent the time,
    I did the work,
    the list is complete,

    And ready for your review:

    * Surfing
    * Programming

    Thus ends The List.
